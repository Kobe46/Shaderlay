# RetroArch Shaderlay Injection
This is a hakchi/hakchi2 module which will add Shaders to the default folder location on NES Mini:
"/etc/libretro/shaders"

# Installation:
1.	Copy Shaderlay.hmod folder into your user_mods folder in Hakchi.
2.	Copy any shader file from the included "shaders" folder in the release and place it in "Shaderlay.hmod/etc/libretro/shaders".		
3.	Open Hakchi > Modules > Install extra modules. Now select Shaderlay. Cick OK.
4.	Follow instructions to synchronize the module to NES Classic.
5.	Shaders should now be placed in the correct folder on the NES Mini. If you wish to Load Preset skip to Load Preset instructions.
6. 	RetroArch menu > Quick Menu > Shaders > Shader Pass, set it to 1.
7.	Select Shader #0 and choose a shader you wish to use, Select Filter (use left and right to select), Select the Scale (how many times you wish to scale to)
8.	After all that is done for what you like, when you go to Apply Shader Changes and hit A. It takes affect right away.

*Do remember that the more you apply the more intensive it gets. It can be very laggy.

#Load Preset:
1.	If you wish to see how the preset shader work RetroArch menu > Quick Menu > Shaders > Load Shader Preset > Select a shader you wish to use.
2.	Do not choose Apply Shader Changes, this will just reset it

# Uninstall

1.  Open Hakchi > Modules > Uninstall extra modules. Select Shaderlay.

2.  Sync the NES, and all the added shaders should now be gone, and only the original set will be there.
